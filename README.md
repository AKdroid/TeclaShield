Tecla Shield
============

The [Tecla Shield](http://mobile-accessibility.idrc.ocad.ca/projects/tekla/the-shield) is a device that enables connection of powered wheelchairs and adapted switches to Bluetooth-enabled electronic devices. Together with the [Tecla App](http://komodoopenlab.com/tecla/the-app/), the Tecla Shield may be used to access and control Android-powered devices and is also available for the iPhone and iPad.

2. To work on the firmware, download and install the [Arduino software](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
3. The firmware for the Tecla Shield is available in the *sketches* directory, simply open the project you want to work on from the Arduino development environment.
4. Hack away! but please make sure you follow [this branching model] (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). That means, make your pull requests against the **develop** branch, not the **master** branch.
